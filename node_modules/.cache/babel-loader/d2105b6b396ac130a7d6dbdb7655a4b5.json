The Company does not discriminate against or allow harassment of any employee based on the employee’s race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, ancestry, pregnancy, or any other basis prohibited by law, or based on the employee’s protected activity under state and federal anti-discrimination statutes. The Company will not tolerate unlawful discrimination or harassment of any kind. Through enforcement of this policy and education of employees, the Company will seek to prevent, correct, and discipline behavior that violates this policy.\n  \n  This prohibition covers any discrimination or harassment in the workplace, regardless of whether the discrimination or harassment is committed by a supervisor, officer, co-worker or non-employee, such as a vendor, consultant, or employee or officer of an affiliate, or invitee to a Company-sponsored activity, event or meeting. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against any person who violates this policy. Based on the seriousness of the offense, disciplinary action may include verbal or written reprimand, suspension, or termination of employment. \n  Prohibited Conduct Under This Policy\n  Discrimination\nIt is a violation of Company policy to discriminate in the provision of employment opportunities, benefits or privileges, or to use discriminatory evaluative standards in employment, if the basis of that discriminatory treatment, in whole or in part, the person's race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, ancestry, pregnancy, or any other characteristic protected by law.\n\nDiscrimination in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary measures up to and including termination.\nHarassment\nHarassment consists of unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct that is based on another person’s race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, ancestry, pregnancy, or any other characteristic protected by law. It may include, but is not limited to, actions such as the use of epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, jokes, or threatening, intimidating or hostile acts that relate to sex, race, ethnicity, age, disability or other protected categories. Harassment also may include written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility toward an individual or group based on protected characteristics, whether that material is sent by email; placed on walls, bulletin boards, computer screens or other devices, or elsewhere on the premises; or circulated in the workplace.\n\nUnwelcome conduct can constitute harassment if:\n\nIt has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;\nIt creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment; or.\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment.\nSexual Harassment\nSexual harassment constitutes a form of prohibited gender-based harassment. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: (i) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment; (ii) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or (iii) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\nThe following is only a partial list of sexually harassing conduct:\n\nExplicit sexual propositions;\nOffering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;\nMaking threats or retaliating after a negative response to sexual advances;\nSexual innuendo or sexually suggestive or sexually degrading comments about a person’s body, sex life, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies;\nSexually oriented jokes, derogatory comments, epithets, slurs or catcalls;\nObscene language, letters, notes or invitations (including by email);\nPhysical contact such as touching or impeding movements;\nConduct such as leering or making sexual gestures;\nDisplaying or distributing pornography or other sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons or posters (including by email, or viewed or shared on a work computer or other device); or,\nSexual content in text messages;\nUnwelcome sexual conduct can constitute harassment if:\n\nIt has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;\nIt creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment;\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\nEmployment; or\nSubmission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is used as the basis for tangible employment actions taken toward her or him.\nObscene language, letters, notes or invitations (including by email);\nPhysical contact such as touching or impeding movements;\nConduct such as leering or making sexual gestures;\nDisplaying or distributing pornography or other sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons or posters (including by email, or viewed or shared on a work computer or other device); or,\nSexual content in text messages;\nRetaliation\nNo hardship, loss, benefit, or penalty may be imposed on an employee in response to:\n\nFiling or responding to a bona fide complaint of discrimination or harassment.\nAppearing as a witness in the investigation of a complaint.\nServing as an investigator of a complaint.\nLodging a bona fide complaint will in no way be used against the employee or have an adverse impact on the individual’s employment status. However, filing groundless or malicious complaints is an abuse of this policy and will be treated as a violation.\n\nAny person who is found to have violated this aspect of the policy will be subject to discipline up to and including the termination of employment.\n\nComplaint and Investigation Procedure\nThe Company has established a formal procedure for the handling of discrimination or harassment complaints. This procedure is intended to supplement—not to replace or supersede—the other procedures available under any applicable laws.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report any incident of discrimination or harassment as soon as possible to their immediate supervisor, HR manager, or any management level employee.\nThe report should be made in writing and include all details of the incident or incidents.\nIf the immediate supervisor is involved in the alleged harassment, the complaint should be filed with the next higher level of management.\nThe Company will promptly investigate all allegations of harassment and take appropriate corrective action, if warranted.\nThe details of the investigation will be kept confidential to the extent possible.\nA. General Principles\nThe Company strongly encourages you to come forward with a complaint at the earliest possible point. You should not wait to report harassment until it becomes severe and pervasive. The Company is committed to stopping discrimination and harassment even if the conduct has not risen to the level of a violation of law. If you feel comfortable doing so, you should respond to discriminatory or harassing conduct in a way that demonstrates that the conduct is unwelcome. However, you are not required to complain directly to the offending individual. Efforts will be made to investigate and resolve complaints promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as confidential a manner as is possible, consistent with proper investigation of the complaint. If a person is accused of discrimination or harassment, he or she shall not play any role in administering or making decisions under this procedure. If an individual is determined to have engaged in discrimination or harassment, appropriate corrective action will be taken promptly, and appropriate sanctions will be imposed, up to and including termination. There will be no retaliation or other adverse action taken against any individual who makes a complaint, reports an incident of apparent discrimination or harassment, or provides information in the course of the investigation of such a complaint or report. Any such retaliation also can be the subject of a complaint under this procedure. If retaliation in fact occurred, prompt and appropriate corrective action will be taken and appropriate sanctions imposed, up to and including termination.\n\nB. Procedure\nIf you believe that you have been the target of discrimination or harassment, the Company encourages you to report the incident(s) in question as soon after the incident occurs as possible to the Practice Administrator, or any supervisor or manager. If the person accused of discrimination or harassment is the Practice Administrator, you may submit your complaint to another officer, manager, or supervisor of the Company to handle the complaint.\nThe complainant shall provide the Practice Administrator with a description of the alleged discrimination or harassment in as much detail as possible, including a description of what occurred and the date(s), time(s) and place(s) of the incident(s). The complainant also should provide the names of individuals who he or she believes have information relevant to the investigation. Practice Administrator may request that this information be provided in writing.\nWhere appropriate and possible, the Practice Administrator may attempt to resolve the matter informally.\nIf informal efforts are not appropriate or successful, the Practice Administrator will conduct an investigation to determine whether discrimination or harassment has occurred.\nDuring the course of the investigation, the Practice Administrator will inform the individual alleged to have engaged in discrimination or harassment of the complaint and will give her or him the opportunity to respond to the allegations and to submit the names of individuals who she or he believes have information relevant to the investigation.\nThe investigation may include meeting with the complainant, the accused and other individuals who may have relevant information. Relevant documents also may be reviewed. The investigation will be conducted promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as confidential a manner as is possible consistent with proper investigation of the complaint.\nIf necessary, the Company will take steps to ensure that discrimination or harassment does not occur during the period of investigation.\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the Practice Administrator shall make a determination of whether discrimination or harassment occurred.\nIf the investigation establishes that discrimination or harassment has occurred, the Company will take prompt and appropriate action. This may include corrective action designed to end and to remedy the discrimination or harassment and to prevent it from reoccurring. Action may include imposition of discipline on the discriminator/harasser, ranging from reprimand to discharge if that person is an employee. If the discriminator/harasser is an employee of a vendor, consultant, or any other employing entity, the Company may inform that employing entity of the investigation and findings, and request further disciplinary actions be taken by that entity. The Company will take all possible steps to ensure that the complainant is no longer subject to the discrimination or harassment.\nThe Company will inform both the complainant and the accused of the outcome of the investigation and, in general terms, of any measures taken to correct the discrimination or harassment.\nIf the investigation establishes that discrimination or harassment has occurred, the Practice Administrator will ensure that the discrimination or harassment has not resumed, and that neither the complainant nor any other individual has been subjected to any retaliation for having complained of the discrimination or harassment, reported an incident of apparent discrimination or harassment, or provided information during the investigation.\nAdditional Enforcement Information\nIn addition to the Company’s internal complaint procedure, employees should also be aware that the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Florida Commission of Human Relations (FCHR) investigate and prosecute complaints of harassment and discrimination in employment. You may contact them directly and their respective numbers are located on the employee information bulletin board in the lunchroom.\n\nModifications\nThis policy can be modified by the Company at any time without notice. Modifications may be necessary, among other reasons, to maintain compliance with State and Federal regulations, guidelines and/or accommodate organizational changes within the Company. \n\n\n`;\n  const handleSubmit = async e => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch(\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/anti_harassment_submit_form/\", {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        headers: {\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n          date,\n          printedName,\n          signatureImageData\n        })\n      });\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(\"Failed to save form data\");\n      }\n      const result = await response.json();\n      console.log(\"Form saved successfully:\", result);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error saving form:\", error);\n    }\n  };\n  return /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(React.Fragment, null, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"br\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 177,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }\n  }), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Header, {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 178,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }\n  }), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"form\", {\n    onSubmit: handleSubmit,\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 179,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    className: \"container\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 180,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    class: \"container\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 181,\n      columnNumber: 11\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"h1\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 182,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, \"Anti-Harassment and Discrimination Policy\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 184,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"strong\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 185,\n      columnNumber: 15\n    }\n  }, \"POLICY STATEMENT\")), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 187,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, \"Health and Psychiatry (the \\u201CCompany\\u201D) is committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, where people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.

Harassment also may include written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility toward an individual or group based on protected characteristics, whether that material is sent by email; placed on walls, bulletin boards, computer screens or other devices, or elsewhere on the premises; or circulated in the workplace.\n\nUnwelcome conduct can constitute harassment if:\n\nIt has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;\nIt creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment; or.\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment.\nSexual Harassment\nSexual harassment constitutes a form of prohibited gender-based harassment. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: (i) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment; (ii) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or (iii) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\nThe following is only a partial list of sexually harassing conduct:\n\nExplicit sexual propositions;\nOffering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;\nMaking threats or retaliating after a negative response to sexual advances;\nSexual innuendo or sexually suggestive or sexually degrading comments about a person’s body, sex life, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies;\nSexually oriented jokes, derogatory comments, epithets, slurs or catcalls;\nObscene language, letters, notes or invitations (including by email);\nPhysical contact such as touching or impeding movements;\nConduct such as leering or making sexual gestures;\nDisplaying or distributing pornography or other sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons or posters (including by email, or viewed or shared on a work computer or other device); or,\nSexual content in text messages;\nUnwelcome sexual conduct can constitute harassment if:\n\nIt has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;\nIt creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment;\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\nEmployment; or\nSubmission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is used as the basis for tangible employment actions taken toward her or him.\nObscene language, letters, notes or invitations (including by email);\nPhysical contact such as touching or impeding movements;\nConduct such as leering or making sexual gestures;\nDisplaying or distributing pornography or other sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons or posters (including by email, or viewed or shared on a work computer or other device); or,\nSexual content in text messages;\nRetaliation\nNo hardship, loss, benefit, or penalty may be imposed on an employee in response to:\n\nFiling or responding to a bona fide complaint of discrimination or harassment.\nAppearing as a witness in the investigation of a complaint.\nServing as an investigator of a complaint.\nLodging a bona fide complaint will in no way be used against the employee or have an adverse impact on the individual’s employment status. However, filing groundless or malicious complaints is an abuse of this policy and will be treated as a violation.\n\nAny person who is found to have violated this aspect of the policy will be subject to discipline up to and including the termination of employment.\n\nComplaint and Investigation Procedure\nThe Company has established a formal procedure for the handling of discrimination or harassment complaints. This procedure is intended to supplement—not to replace or supersede—the other procedures available under any applicable laws.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report any incident of discrimination or harassment as soon as possible to their immediate supervisor, HR manager, or any management level employee.\nThe report should be made in writing and include all details of the incident or incidents.\nIf the immediate supervisor is involved in the alleged harassment, the complaint should be filed with the next higher level of management.\nThe Company will promptly investigate all allegations of harassment and take appropriate corrective action, if warranted.\nThe details of the investigation will be kept confidential to the extent possible.\nA. General Principles\nThe Company strongly encourages you to come forward with a complaint at the earliest possible point. You should not wait to report harassment until it becomes severe and pervasive. The Company is committed to stopping discrimination and harassment even if the conduct has not risen to the level of a violation of law. If you feel comfortable doing so, you should respond to discriminatory or harassing conduct in a way that demonstrates that the conduct is unwelcome. However, you are not required to complain directly to the offending individual. Efforts will be made to investigate and resolve complaints promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as confidential a manner as is possible, consistent with proper investigation of the complaint. If a person is accused of discrimination or harassment, he or she shall not play any role in administering or making decisions under this procedure. If an individual is determined to have engaged in discrimination or harassment, appropriate corrective action will be taken promptly, and appropriate sanctions will be imposed, up to and including termination. There will be no retaliation or other adverse action taken against any individual who makes a complaint, reports an incident of apparent discrimination or harassment, or provides information in the course of the investigation of such a complaint or report. Any such retaliation also can be the subject of a complaint under this procedure. If retaliation in fact occurred, prompt and appropriate corrective action will be taken and appropriate sanctions imposed, up to and including termination.\n\nB. Procedure\nIf you believe that you have been the target of discrimination or harassment, the Company encourages you to report the incident(s) in question as soon after the incident occurs as possible to the Practice Administrator, or any supervisor or manager. If the person accused of discrimination or harassment is the Practice Administrator, you may submit your complaint to another officer, manager, or supervisor of the Company to handle the complaint.\nThe complainant shall provide the Practice Administrator with a description of the alleged discrimination or harassment in as much detail as possible, including a description of what occurred and the date(s), time(s) and place(s) of the incident(s). The complainant also should provide the names of individuals who he or she believes have information relevant to the investigation. Practice Administrator may request that this information be provided in writing.\nWhere appropriate and possible, the Practice Administrator may attempt to resolve the matter informally.\nIf informal efforts are not appropriate or successful, the Practice Administrator will conduct an investigation to determine whether discrimination or harassment has occurred.\nDuring the course of the investigation, the Practice Administrator will inform the individual alleged to have engaged in discrimination or harassment of the complaint and will give her or him the opportunity to respond to the allegations and to submit the names of individuals who she or he believes have information relevant to the investigation.\nThe investigation may include meeting with the complainant, the accused and other individuals who may have relevant information. Relevant documents also may be reviewed. The investigation will be conducted promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as confidential a manner as is possible consistent with proper investigation of the complaint.\nIf necessary, the Company will take steps to ensure that discrimination or harassment does not occur during the period of investigation.\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the Practice Administrator shall make a determination of whether discrimination or harassment occurred.\nIf the investigation establishes that discrimination or harassment has occurred, the Company will take prompt and appropriate action. This may include corrective action designed to end and to remedy the discrimination or harassment and to prevent it from reoccurring. Action may include imposition of discipline on the discriminator/harasser, ranging from reprimand to discharge if that person is an employee. If the discriminator/harasser is an employee of a vendor, consultant, or any other employing entity, the Company may inform that employing entity of the investigation and findings, and request further disciplinary actions be taken by that entity. The Company will take all possible steps to ensure that the complainant is no longer subject to the discrimination or harassment.\nThe Company will inform both the complainant and the accused of the outcome of the investigation and, in general terms, of any measures taken to correct the discrimination or harassment.\nIf the investigation establishes that discrimination or harassment has occurred, the Practice Administrator will ensure that the discrimination or harassment has not resumed, and that neither the complainant nor any other individual has been subjected to any retaliation for having complained of the discrimination or harassment, reported an incident of apparent discrimination or harassment, or provided information during the investigation.\nAdditional Enforcement Information\nIn addition to the Company’s internal complaint procedure, employees should also be aware that the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Florida Commission of Human Relations (FCHR) investigate and prosecute complaints of harassment and discrimination in employment. You may contact them directly and their respective numbers are located on the employee information bulletin board in the lunchroom.\n\nModifications\nThis policy can be modified by the Company at any time without notice. Modifications may be necessary, among other reasons, to maintain compliance with State and Federal regulations, guidelines and/or accommodate organizational changes within the Company. \n\n\n`;\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch(\n        \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/anti_harassment_submit_form/\",\n        {\n          method: \"POST\",\n          headers: {\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n          },\n          body: JSON.stringify({\n            date,\n            printedName,\n            signatureImageData,\n          }),\n        }\n      );\n\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(\"Failed to save form data\");\n      }\n\n      const result = await response.json();\n      console.log(\"Form saved successfully:\", result);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error saving form:\", error);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <br></br>\n      <Header />\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div class=\"container\">\n            <h1>Anti-Harassment and Discrimination Policy</h1>\n\n            <p>\n              <strong>POLICY STATEMENT</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Health and Psychiatry (the “Company”) is committed to creating and\n              maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment,\n              where people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.

If\n              retaliation in fact occurred, prompt and appropriate corrective\n              action will be taken and appropriate sanctions imposed, up to and\n              including termination.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>B. Procedure</h3>\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                If you believe that you have been the target of discrimination\n                or harassment, the Company encourages you to report the\n                incident(s) in question as soon after the incident occurs as\n                possible to the Practice Administrator, or any supervisor or\n                manager. If the person accused of discrimination or harassment\n                is the Practice Administrator, you may submit your complaint to\n                another officer, manager, or supervisor of the Company to handle\n                the complaint.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The complainant shall provide the Practice Administrator with a\n                description of the alleged discrimination or harassment in as\n                much detail as possible, including a description of what\n                occurred and the date(s), time(s) and place(s) of the\n                incident(s). The complainant also should provide the names of\n                individuals who he or she believes have information relevant to\n                the investigation. Practice Administrator may request that this\n                information be provided in writing.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Where appropriate and possible, the Practice Administrator may\n                attempt to resolve the matter informally.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If informal efforts are not appropriate or successful, the\n                Practice Administrator will conduct an investigation to\n                determine whether discrimination or harassment has occurred.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                During the course of the investigation, the Practice\n                Administrator will inform the individual alleged to have engaged\n                in discrimination or harassment of the complaint and will give\n                her or him the opportunity to respond to the allegations and to\n                submit the names of individuals who she or he believes have\n                information relevant to the investigation.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The investigation may include meeting with the complainant, the\n                accused and other individuals who may have relevant information.\n                Relevant documents also may be reviewed. The investigation will\n                be conducted promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as\n                confidential a manner as is possible consistent with proper\n                investigation of the complaint.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If necessary, the Company will take steps to ensure that\n                discrimination or harassment does not occur during the period of\n                investigation.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                At the conclusion of the investigation, the Practice\n                Administrator shall make a determination of whether\n                discrimination or harassment occurred.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If the investigation establishes that discrimination or\n                harassment has occurred, the Company will take prompt and\n                appropriate action. This may include corrective action designed\n                to end and to remedy the discrimination or harassment and to\n                prevent it from reoccurring. Action may include imposition of\n                discipline on the discriminator/harasser, ranging from reprimand\n                to discharge if that person is an employee. If the\n                discriminator/harasser is an employee of a vendor, consultant,\n                or any other employing entity, the Company may inform that\n                employing entity of the investigation and findings, and request\n                further disciplinary actions be taken by that entity. The\n                Company will take all possible steps to ensure that the\n                complainant is no longer subject to the discrimination or\n                harassment.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The Company will inform both the complainant and the accused of\n                the outcome of the investigation and, in general terms, of any\n                measures taken to correct the discrimination or harassment.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If the investigation establishes that discrimination or\n                harassment has occurred, the Practice Administrator will ensure\n                that the discrimination or harassment has not resumed, and that\n                neither the complainant nor any other individual has been\n                subjected to any retaliation for having complained of the\n                discrimination or harassment, reported an incident of apparent\n                discrimination or harassment, or provided information during the\n                investigation.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n            <h2>Additional Enforcement Information</h2>\n            <p>\n              In addition to the Company’s internal complaint procedure,\n              employees should also be aware that the Federal Equal Employment\n              Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Florida Commission of Human\n              Relations (FCHR) investigate and prosecute complaints of\n              harassment and discrimination in employment.
