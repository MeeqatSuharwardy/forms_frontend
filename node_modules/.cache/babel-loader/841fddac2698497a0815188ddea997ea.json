General Principles</h3>\n            <p>\n              The Company strongly encourages you to come forward with a\n              complaint at the earliest possible point. You should not wait to\n              report harassment until it becomes severe and pervasive. The\n              Company is committed to stopping discrimination and harassment\n              even if the conduct has not risen to the level of a violation of\n              law. If you feel comfortable doing so, you should respond to\n              discriminatory or harassing conduct in a way that demonstrates\n              that the conduct is unwelcome. However, you are not required to\n              complain directly to the offending individual. Efforts will be\n              made to investigate and resolve complaints promptly, thoroughly,\n              impartially and in as confidential a manner as is possible,\n              consistent with proper investigation of the complaint. If a person\n              is accused of discrimination or harassment, he or she shall not\n              play any role in administering or making decisions under this\n              procedure. If an individual is determined to have engaged in\n              discrimination or harassment, appropriate corrective action will\n              be taken promptly, and appropriate sanctions will be imposed, up\n              to and including termination. There will be no retaliation or\n              other adverse action taken against any individual who makes a\n              complaint, reports an incident of apparent discrimination or\n              harassment, or provides information in the course of the\n              investigation of such a complaint or report. Any such retaliation\n              also can be the subject of a complaint under this procedure. If\n              retaliation in fact occurred, prompt and appropriate corrective\n              action will be taken and appropriate sanctions imposed, up to and\n              including termination.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>B. Procedure</h3>\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                If you believe that you have been the target of discrimination\n                or harassment, the Company encourages you to report the\n                incident(s) in question as soon after the incident occurs as\n                possible to the Practice Administrator, or any supervisor or\n                manager. If the person accused of discrimination or harassment\n                is the Practice Administrator, you may submit your complaint to\n                another officer, manager, or supervisor of the Company to handle\n                the complaint.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The complainant shall provide the Practice Administrator with a\n                description of the alleged discrimination or harassment in as\n                much detail as possible, including a description of what\n                occurred and the date(s), time(s) and place(s) of the\n                incident(s). The complainant also should provide the names of\n                individuals who he or she believes have information relevant to\n                the investigation. Practice Administrator may request that this\n                information be provided in writing.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Where appropriate and possible, the Practice Administrator may\n                attempt to resolve the matter informally.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If informal efforts are not appropriate or successful, the\n                Practice Administrator will conduct an investigation to\n                determine whether discrimination or harassment has occurred.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                During the course of the investigation, the Practice\n                Administrator will inform the individual alleged to have engaged\n                in discrimination or harassment of the complaint and will give\n                her or him the opportunity to respond to the allegations and to\n                submit the names of individuals who she or he believes have\n                information relevant to the investigation.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The investigation may include meeting with the complainant, the\n                accused and other individuals who may have relevant information.\n                Relevant documents also may be reviewed. The investigation will\n                be conducted promptly, thoroughly, impartially and in as\n                confidential a manner as is possible consistent with proper\n                investigation of the complaint.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If necessary, the Company will take steps to ensure that\n                discrimination or harassment does not occur during the period of\n                investigation.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                At the conclusion of the investigation, the Practice\n                Administrator shall make a determination of whether\n                discrimination or harassment occurred.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If the investigation establishes that discrimination or\n                harassment has occurred, the Company will take prompt and\n                appropriate action. This may include corrective action designed\n                to end and to remedy the discrimination or harassment and to\n                prevent it from reoccurring. Action may include imposition of\n                discipline on the discriminator/harasser, ranging from reprimand\n                to discharge if that person is an employee. If the\n                discriminator/harasser is an employee of a vendor, consultant,\n                or any other employing entity, the Company may inform that\n                employing entity of the investigation and findings, and request\n                further disciplinary actions be taken by that entity. The\n                Company will take all possible steps to ensure that the\n                complainant is no longer subject to the discrimination or\n                harassment.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The Company will inform both the complainant and the accused of\n                the outcome of the investigation and, in general terms, of any\n                measures taken to correct the discrimination or harassment.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                If the investigation establishes that discrimination or\n                harassment has occurred, the Practice Administrator will ensure\n                that the discrimination or harassment has not resumed, and that\n                neither the complainant nor any other individual has been\n                subjected to any retaliation for having complained of the\n                discrimination or harassment, reported an incident of apparent\n                discrimination or harassment, or provided information during the\n                investigation.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n            <h2>Additional Enforcement Information</h2>\n            <p>\n              In addition to the Company’s internal complaint procedure,\n              employees should also be aware that the Federal Equal Employment\n              Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Florida Commission of Human\n              Relations (FCHR) investigate and prosecute complaints of\n              harassment and discrimination in employment. You may contact them\n              directly and their respective numbers are located on the employee\n              information bulletin board in the lunchroom.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Modifications</h2>\n            <p>\n              This policy can be modified by the Company at any time without\n              notice.
